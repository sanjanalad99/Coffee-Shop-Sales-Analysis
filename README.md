# Coffee-Shop-Sales-Dashboard
#Situation:
Assumed that I recently became a franchise owner at Mavern Roasters, a coffee shop chain with 3 locations in NY city.

#Assignment
To better understand purchase behavior and streamline operations you have collected transactional data from Jan-Jun 2023.

#GOAL
To transform the data into a dynamic dashboard that franchise owners can useto identify patterns, trends and opportunities for the business.

#Objectives
1. Profiled and prepared raw data for analysis
2. Explored the data with Excel Pivot Tables
3. Built dynamic dashboard to visualize patterns and trends


Objective 1: Prepared the data for analysis
-Took a moment to familiarize myself with the data. How many transactions were recorded,over what period of time? What products and product categories were sold?
-Added a new column to calculate revenue(Price * Quantity)
-Added new columns to calculate Month and Day of Week based on the  transaction date
-Added a new column to extract hour from the transaction time

Objective 2: Explored the data with Pivot tables(Slicing and dicing the data)
-Inserted a pivot table on a new tab to show revenue by month
-Added two or more Pivot Tables(on the same sheet) to show the number of transactions by product category, sort in descending by transactions
-Added a Pivot Table(on the same sheet) to show the no. of transactions and revenue by product type, sorted descending and filtered to the top 15(by transactions)

Objective 3: Building of the dynamic dashboard(visualization)
-Added pivot charts to show revenue by moth as a line chart, transactions by day of week and hour of day as column charts, and transactions by product category as a bar chart
- Assembled the charts into a rough dashboard layout, and included space for the Pivot Table showing top 15 product types
- Added a slicer for store location and connect it to all pivot tables on the sheet
  -Adjusted formatting, alignment and polished to finalize the dashboard
- Visualized any interesting patterns or trends

Observations:
Business insight/recommendation or data driven descisions
inetersting patterns in Transactions by day of week and hour of day
For Manhattan Location - huge spike in  sales from 7am - 10am
major spike in salkes on monday
evening 7-8pm -not making much sales-observatrion -losing money by keeping store open past 6pm
improve margins  by changing the operating hours
Product level trends-
In Manhattan-espresso-popular
coffee and tea are top products
compating with astoria - chai tea is more popular here in astoria,  o heavy traffic on monday as in manhattan, is open until 7pm but makes good sales unlike manhattan. Sales are stable throughout the day in astoria

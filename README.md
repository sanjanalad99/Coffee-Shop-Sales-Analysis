# Coffee-Shop-Sales-Dashboard Extravaganza ðŸŽ‰â˜•

### Situation:
Imagine this - I've just jumped into the caffeinated world of franchise ownership with Mavern Roasters, a cozy chain with 3 buzzing locations in the heart of NY city. It's like being handed the keys to a chocolate factory, but for coffee!

### Assignment:
My mission, should I choose to accept it (and I totally did), is to dive deep into the ocean of transactional data from Jan-Jun 2023. The goal? To whip up a dynamic dashboard that's not just a feast for the eyes but a crystal ball into the soul of purchase behavior and a magic wand for streamlining operations.

### GOAL:
Transforming data into a dashboard that not only talks but sings about patterns, trends, and golden opportunities for Mavern Roasters.

### Objectives (The Recipe for Success):

#### Objective 1: Prepping the Data Like a Masterchef
- Took a whirlwind tour through the data - it's like a diary of every latte, espresso, and muffin we've ever sold.
- Added a sprinkle of magic with a new column for revenue (Price * Quantity = ðŸ’°).
- Crafted columns to slice time by Month and Day of the Week, because who sold what and when is the new who's who.
- Snuck in a column to catch the hour - because in the world of coffee, timing is everything.

#### Objective 2: The Great Data Bake-off with Pivot Tables
- Whipped up a Pivot Table that sings a monthly revenue opera.
- Marshalled two more Pivot Table soldiers to rank product categories by popularity - because knowing your bestseller is half the battle.
- Summoned a Pivot Table wizard to reveal the top 15 product types by transactions - it's like America's Got Talent, but for coffee products.

#### Objective 3: Assembling the Avengers - The Dynamic Dashboard
- Brought to life a line chart that tracks revenue by month - it's like watching the heartbeat of Mavern Roasters.
- Erected column charts to display transactions by day of the week and hour of the day - it's where time meets money.
- Crafted a bar chart that showcases transactions by product category - because everyone loves a good popularity contest.
- Arranged all these chart superheroes into a dashboard that's more captivating than a Broadway show.
- Added a slicer for store location - it's like having a remote control for your data, zapping through locations with the push of a button.
- Gave the dashboard a makeover - because looks matter.

### Observations: The Plot Thickens

#### Business Insight/Recommendations:
- **For the Manhattan Maverns**: Mornings are gold (7am - 10am) with a caffeine rush that could rival the New York Marathon. Mondays are like the Super Bowl of sales - everyone needs that coffee kickstart. But post-6pm, it's crickets - might as well roll up the sidewalks.
  - **Idea**: Let's not play night owls. Closing at 6pm could be our ticket to cost-saving glory.

#### Product-Level Trends:
- **Espresso in Manhattan** is the crown prince, with coffee and tea as the loyal court.
- **Astoriaâ€™s Twist**: Chai tea steals the spotlight, proving every neighborhood has its own caffeine anthem. Unlike Manhattan, evenings here are buzzing, not snoozing.
  
### Conclusion:
Every Mavern Roasters location is a unique snowflake in the blizzard of New York's coffee scene. By tailoring our operations to the rhythms and preferences of each neighborhood, we're not just selling coffee - we're brewing success.
